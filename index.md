### 👋 Hi there, I'm Marco Cardia

<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Marco Cardia profile photo" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 250px; border-radius: 50%;" />

Born and raised in the beautiful island of Sardinia, I'm a computer scientist and currently a PostDoc at the University of Pisa. I'm passionate about applying Machine Learning to solve real world challenges in environmental science and digital accessibility.

My work focuses on building robust, data-driven systems that can interpret complex data, spacing from spectroscopic signals in water to visual information in scientific documents. I am driven by a mission to transform data into meaningful, actionable insights and to make technology more inclusive.

### Research Focus

My doctoral research centers on developing advanced **soft-sensing systems** using Machine Learning and UV-Vis spectroscopy. This involves tackling challenges like data scarcity with **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)** and ensuring model transparency through interpretability techniques.

I am now expanding this research into the crucial field of **digital accessibility**, leveraging AI to make scientific and technical visual content, such as charts, graphs, and diagrams, fully accessible to visually impaired users by generating meaningful and accurate alternative descriptions.

### 📚 Publications

My research has been published in several peer-reviewed conferences and journals. My work focuses on the application of machine learning for environmental monitoring and, more recently, digital accessibility.
